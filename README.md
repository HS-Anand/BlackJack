# BlackJack
Welcome to the Blackjack game implemented in Python! This project is a simple text-based simulation of the popular card game, allowing users to play against a dealer controlled by the program.

Features

Player vs Dealer: Play against the computer-controlled dealer.

Standard Blackjack Rules: The game follows the standard rules of Blackjack, including options to hit, stand, and double down.

Deck and Card Management: The game uses a standard deck of 52 cards, shuffled at the start of each game.

Score Calculation: Accurate calculation of hand values and determination of win/loss conditions.

Game Rules

The goal is to get as close to 21 points as possible without exceeding it.

Both the player and the dealer are dealt two cards at the start. The player can see one of the dealer's cards.

The player can choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).

The dealer must hit until their hand value is at least 17.

The player wins if they have a higher hand value than the dealer without exceeding 21, or if the dealer busts (goes over 21).
